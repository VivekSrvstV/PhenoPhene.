                            <strong>The PhenoPhene is a meticulously maintained and standardized database that serves as a repository for information on Phenotype, QTLs, SNPs, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for various plant species.</strong> It is a reliable source of information that undergoes quality control and manual curation. The repository offers various views that allow users to gain an overview of the most commonly associated markers across all phenotypes available in the PhenoPhene, which is a central and publicly accessible repository for plant species phenotypes. With a full-text Elasticsearch, users can easily query the database for their preferred Phenotype, QTLs, SNPs, traits, or studies. The database offers detailed views with interactive visualizations for genes, phenotypes, and studies. These features help users gain an in-depth understanding of the top associations within the database. Various filters can be employed to refine the search outcomes, including the filtration of SNPs based on specific minor allele frequencies or genome annotations.
